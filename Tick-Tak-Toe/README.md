![Project Screenshot](./screenshots/s2.jpg)

## Overview

This is a starter template for creating React projects with Tailwind CSS using Vite as the build tool. Vite is a fast and efficient development tool that allows for quick project setup and smooth development experience. With this template, you can start building React applications with the power of Tailwind CSS utility classes right out of the box.

## Features

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- Vite: A fast build tool and development server for creating modern web projects.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory using the command line.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Folder Structure

- `/src`: Contains the main source code for the React app.
  - `/components`: Contains the individual React components used in the app.
  - `/assets`: Includes images and other static assets used in the app.
  - `/App.js`: The main component that orchestrates the app's logic and state.
  - `/index.js`: Entry point of the React app.

## Customizing Styles

This project is set up with Tailwind CSS, which allows for easy customization of styles. You can modify the styles in the `tailwind.config.js` file and add or remove utility classes as needed.
